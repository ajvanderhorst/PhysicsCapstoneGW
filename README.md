# Physics Capstone GW
**_Course Materials for Physics Capstone Experience at The George Washington University_**

The Physics capstone experience at The George Washington University was revamped in 2018, with a focus on various research skills, career preparedness, societal outreach and impact, community building and issues, and written and oral communication skills. All Physics majors (including the BS in Physics, Biophysics, and Astronomy & Astrophysics, and the BA in Physics) take the Physics Capstone course (PHYS 4195W; 3 credits) in the Fall of the junior year. During the Spring of the junior year and Fall of the senior year, the BS students (and some of the BA students) do most of their undergraduate research project under the supervision of a faculty member (3 credits). In the Spring of the senior year, the BS students (and some of the BA students) take the Physics Symposium course (PHYS 4200; 1 credit), which guides them in preparing a report, poster and presentation on their research project. Students can earn credit in the Physics Capstone course for two elements of their General Education Curriculum: Writing and Oral Communication.

This repository contains materials of both courses, including the [syllabus](CapstoneSyllabus.md) and [class materials](CapstoneClasses.md) (including slides and grading rubrics) of the Capstone course, and the [syllabus](SymposiumSyllabus.md) and [class materials](SymposiumClasses.md) of the Symposium course. These courses have been taught since the 2018-2019 academic year, for class sizes varying from a handful to 20 students. The courses' structure and materials have been improved upon based on in-class experience and feedback from students. For the Physics Capstone course, the primary instructor typically invites expert guest instructors for some specific aspects of the course, including classes on physics careers, applications for graduate school, physics outreach, and diversity and inclusion. Besides an overview and all materials of the courses, there are separate pages for [certain topics of interest in the Physics Capstone course](Topics/), in particular classes and activities related to [physics careers](Topics/Careers.md), [the physics community](Topics/Community.md), [physics research](Topics/Research.md), [oral presentations](Topics/Presenting.md), and [written communication](Topics/Writing.md). Writing aspects of the course were developed in collaboration with the University Writing Program. A [Fall 2018 article](https://columbian.gwu.edu/physics-professionally-speaking) featured the Physics Capstone course, including interviews with some of the students.

The revisions of the Physics Curriculum at the George Washington University were in line with the [Phys21 report](https://www.compadre.org/jtupp/) of the Joint Task Force on Undergraduate Physics Programs, convened by the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Some of the aspects of the revisions were funded by the [PIPELINE Network](https://www.aps.org/programs/education/innovation/pipeline/index.cfm) of the American Physical Society. The Physics capstone experience was part of curricular innovations that led to the George Washington University receiving the American Physical Society's [Award for Improving Undergraduate Physics Education](https://www.aps.org/programs/education/undergrad/faculty/awardees.cfm).
