# Physics Intermediate Lab Course - Syllabus

_These are most of the general sections of the syllabus, not including the university-specific sections (academic integrity, student support, security, religious holidays, etc.) or the class schedule._


### Course Overview & Learning Objectives

The primary intent of this course is to experiment with a wide variety of physical phenomena and to give you confidence in the laboratory. You will set up and carry out small experiments and several complex experiments, some open-ended and others more prescribed. The experiments change periodically in order to encourage independent exploratory work in the lab. Persistent, creative problem-solving and familiarity with many of the paradigms of the physical world is the goal, along with learning how and when one can make conclusions about aspects of the natural world.  After each experiment, you will be asked to present your results in a variety of ways, including oral, written, and poster-based formats.

The successful student will obtain:
*	practical experience with laboratory instrumentation including error analysis, machine shop skills, oscilloscopes, and data acquisition;
*	experimental familiarity with a variety of electromagnetic, classical, quantum mechanical, atomic and nuclear physics systems;
*	practice with literature searches and finding/using appropriate theoretical resources;
*	skills for recording daily progress, maintaining a detailed laboratory notebook, and collaborating and communicating with peers;
*	computational skills required to perform data analysis, statistical methods, and mathematical modeling of experimental results;
*	proficiency in writing laboratory reports and prose in a variety of formats, including peer-critiquing skills;
*	practice in oral and written communication of subtle scientific ideas, including verbal presentation of research results;
* appreciation of, and ability to expound upon, physics as an exemplar of how science works as a creative enterprise to describe and understand deep truths about the universe, ultimately guided by reproducible experiments. 


### Writing in the Disciplines Learning Objectives

This course satisfies the Written Communication learning objectives of the General Education Curriculum, which are assessed by in-class and homework writing samples. Students who complete this course will be able to:
* recognize and apply rhetorical principles and stylistic conventions appropriate to the discipline in which they are working;
* identify, analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and employ information resources and/or other forms of supporting evidence appropriate to the discipline in which they are working;
* construct rigorous, well-informed arguments and/or sound, probing questions or hypothesis appropriate to the discipline in which they are working;
* apply critical, analytical, and evaluative thinking to their own writing, through drafting, revising, and/or editing processes appropriate to the discipline in which they are working.


### Course Structure

Class meetings are on Thursday morning and Tuesday afternoon. Additionally, on Thursdays and Fridays the laboratory will be available much of the day for you to do research. Students are expected to attend class/work in the lab each Tuesday with the rest of the class, and work with your group at least one other substantial block of time during each week, determined in accordance with your lab partner(s). In addition, significant time should be set aside for fleshing out your lab notebook, completing lab write-ups, preparing for presentations, tests and assignments. You will be assigned various experiments together with a target due dates for the written components.


### Written & Oral Work

You are required to keep a laboratory notebook (large 3-ring binder) for this course in which you will record your day-to-day work. Always begin your weekly entry with the date, time, and name of any lab partners. You are encouraged to work together when taking data and analyzing your results but you should not copy work from one another.  If you do not participate in the data acquisition and/or analysis, you should not include it in your notebook except in very unusual circumstances which must be described. If you do include such data and/or analyses in your final write-up or presentation it should include a credit and citation (as in “Photocopied with permission from XXX’s notebook, who conducted the experiment and took the data with the assistance of YYY and ZZZ.”).

The main goal of keeping a lab book is to record in the moment (or very soon afterward), and for the official record, a version of what happened in the laboratory as discoveries are being made, and to save time by keeping a careful record of what you have already accomplished when it is freshest in your mind.  Your notebook should include:
*	a written record of your weekly research activities, procedures, ideas, false starts, etc.;
*	a diagram of your experimental setup (label equipment with model numbers);
*	instrument settings, range of values to be explored;
*	sketches of scope traces and other important visual results;
*	data and analysis file documentation;
*	theoretical derivations and sample calculations and prose descriptions of subtle points;
*	reference citations;
*	comments about surprising results, and about expected results;
*	an appendix listing ALL instrumentation used in the experiment.

A scientist must be able to communicate their work to others.  You will communicate your work to others by preparing oral/visual presentations.  In addition, you will be asked to prepare various written reports and a poster presentation.

### Tinkering

Advanced experimentation often involves careful tinkering (making small adjustments to an experimental parameter while monitoring a signal or response).  The fundamental rule of tinkering is that individual parameters should be tested independently.  If multiple parameters are adjusted simultaneously, it can be difficult to recover the original signal.  I encourage you to try your hand at tinkering – it takes time to develop, but it can be a very useful skill.  I will be tinkering with the experiments all semester, but I will try to refrain from tinkering with your apparatus without your permission.


### Participation

Oral presentations provide opportunities for you to learn from each other.  Obviously, you must be present and attentive during your colleague’s presentations for this objective to work effectively.  I will monitor and evaluate your participation in this process.  Asking good questions is a reliable way of demonstrating that you are engaged in this exchange. Seminar attendance and completion of various surveys will also contribute to your participation grade. A weekly reading and discussion forum will be set up in Blackboard where you will be expected to respond to questions in writing. 

Attending departmental seminars/colloquia/events is part of your participation grade and will broaden your scientific perspective, improve your networking skills, and show you how physics is being practiced in the world beyond GWU.  Attendance at 6 or more physics seminars/events is required over the course of the semester. Ask questions!


### Library Work

You will be expected to find and read appropriate books and papers in order to understand the physics underlying your experiments.  The American Journal of Physics abstract database is a useful resource that should be consulted for virtually every experiment. You might also find The Physics Teacher archives useful for most experiments.


### Final Project

We will conclude the course with an individual final project.  I will try to identify final projects that are a good fit for each student’s experience and ability, and I am open to suggestions that you might have for your final project.  Please note that the final projects may include evaluation by other faculty in the physics department.  Hence, your posters representing your final projects must be available for review by your peers, and possibly other faculty, on the last day of class which is Thursday April 23. You will also be presenting your posters to me as part of your final exam which is likely to be Tuesday May 5th, but is not officially scheduled yet.


### Distribution of hours spent on coursework

There will be typically two 75-minute lectures per week, totaling 2.5 hours of lectures per week. Out-of-class coursework is estimated to be 5 hours per week, and includes reading materials for classes, doing homework, writing exercises, and preparing for presentations.


### Grading

The final numerical course grade will be calculated as a weighted average of:
* 20%	Lab notebook: written record of daily activity, data, sketches, circuit diagrams, research descriptions, observations, commentary, handout pages (handed in twice during semester)
* 10%	Lab Reports: oral presentations with written documentation, outlines
* 10%	Lab Reports: written, various formats including abstracts, letter, powerpoint version of presentations
* 20%	Participation/Seminar Attendance/Quizzes/Homework/In-Class work/Discussion Board
* 20%	Midterm Exams (two per semester)
* 20% Final Project
