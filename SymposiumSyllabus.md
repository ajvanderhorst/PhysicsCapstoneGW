# Physics Symposium Course - Syllabus

_These are most of the general sections of the syllabus, not including the university-specific sections (academic integrity, student support, security, religious holidays, etc.) or the class schedule._


### Course Overview & Learning Objectives

After taking this course, students will be able to communicate physics research in a disciplinarily and audience appropriate manner. Students will write a final report on their research in subject-appropriate format and style, present a poster on their research at the college- or university-wide Research Showcase, and give an oral presentation on their research at the Physics Undergraduate Symposium Day. All written and oral presentations will be guided by readings and examples, and feedback is provided by both the instructor and the students’ peers.

The course has the following learning objectives:
* demonstrate proficiency in written communication of physics research through a report and producing a poster;
* demonstrate proficiency in oral communication of physics research through presenting a poster and an oral presentation.
*	demonstrate proficiency in peer review of written and oral presentations.


### Course Format

This course is taught in a highly collaborative mode, with a small amount of lecturing and a lot of active participation of the students. There will be a variety of in-class activities, including discussions, presentations and writing exercises. Students are strongly encouraged to ask questions and initiate discussions in class at all times. They will also provide constructive feedback on each other’s reports and presentations through peer review. As a preparation for some classes, the students are expected to read materials provided by the lecturer, and some writing outside of class and preparations for presentations are required.
 

### Distribution of hours spent on coursework

There will be typically one 75-minute lecture per week. Out-of-class coursework is estimated to be 75 minutes per week as well, and includes reading materials for classes, writing the report, developing the poster, and preparing for presentations.


### Grading

The final numerical course grade will be calculated as a weighted average of:
* 10%	class participation and peer review
* 30%	final report on research
* 30%	poster and presentation at Research Showcase
* 30%	oral presentation at Physics Undergraduate Symposium Day
