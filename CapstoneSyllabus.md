# Physics Capstone Course - Syllabus

_These are most of the general sections of the syllabus, not including the university-specific sections (academic integrity, student support, security, religious holidays, etc.) or the class schedule._


### Course Overview & Learning Objectives

After taking this course, students will be able to explain the issues and standards for ethical conduct of research, explain issues related to building a physics community, describe career paths in physics, create applications for employment and graduate studies including resumes and cover letters, and improve their use of the tools of scientific written and oral communication, including learning how to develop proposals for research funding. Readings for class discussions include scientific research papers, examples of research proposals, resources on ethics and career opportunities, and examples of well-written resumes and cover letters. Students will be able to improve their writing and presentations based on instructor and peer feedback in class. Students will interact with the Career Services office. The overarching goal is to help students think about, and develop, practical skills related to physics research, and prepare for their careers after graduation. This course will also prepare students for a research project in their junior and/or senior year, and for presenting this research at various venues.

The course has the following learning objectives:
* explain and discuss the nature of physics research processes and methods;
* explain and discuss ethical conduct of research and physics community issues;
* analyze, interpret and report on physics research articles and proposals;
* explain career paths in physics, and demonstrate how to apply for competitive research opportunities, job employment, and admission into graduate schools;
* demonstrate proficiency in communicating physics ideas and research in an audience- and disciplinarily appropriate manner.


### Writing in the Disciplines Learning Objectives

This course satisfies the Written Communication learning objectives of the General Education Curriculum, which are assessed by in-class and homework writing samples. Students who complete this course will be able to:
* recognize and apply rhetorical principles and stylistic conventions appropriate to the discipline in which they are working;
* identify, analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and employ information resources and/or other forms of supporting evidence appropriate to the discipline in which they are working;
* construct rigorous, well-informed arguments and/or sound, probing questions or hypothesis appropriate to the discipline in which they are working;
* apply critical, analytical, and evaluative thinking to their own writing, through drafting, revising, and/or editing processes appropriate to the discipline in which they are working.


### Oral Communication Learning Objectives

This course also satisfies the Oral Communication learning objectives of the General Education Curriculum, which are assessed by various in-class presentations. Students who complete this course will be able to:
* take responsibility for a significant topic with a clear thesis and persuasive argument;
* demonstrate facility with topical and disciplinary knowledge via well-crafted, audience appropriate language;
* demonstrate vocal qualities and physical behaviors that augment content and maintain audience interest.


### Course Format

This course is taught in an interactive mode, with a small amount of lecturing and a lot of active participation of the students, plus a significant amount of collaborative work. There will be a variety of in-class activities, including discussions, writing exercises, and formal and informal presentations. Students are encouraged to ask questions and initiate discussions in class often. They will provide constructive feedback on each otherâ€™s writing and presentations through peer response. As preparation for classes, students are expected to read materials provided by the instructor once per week, and preparations for presentations are required. The students will hand in homework almost weekly to evaluate their writing skills and understanding of the material.
 

### Distribution of hours spent on coursework

There will be typically two 75-minute lectures per week, totaling 2.5 hours of lectures per week. Out-of-class coursework is estimated to be 5 hours per week, and includes reading materials for classes, doing homework, writing exercises, and preparing for presentations.


### Grading

The final numerical course grade will be calculated as a weighted average of:
* 20%	Class participation and in-class group work
* 20%	Career exploration and preparation assignments
* 20%	Homework assignments
* 20%	Writing assignments 
* 20%	In-class presentations
